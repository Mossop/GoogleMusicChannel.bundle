This is a [Plex](https://plex.tv/) channel for [Google Music](https://music.google.com).

Since the plug-in contains binary code you have to download the right version
for the platform that your Plex server runs on. Then read the docs on how to
[install plug-ins manually](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201187656-How-do-I-manually-install-a-channel-).

Once installed you must enter your username and password into the channel's
preferences. If you use two-factor authentication with your Google account you
must create an application password.
